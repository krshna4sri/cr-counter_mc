ðŸŽ¼ Best Practices for Using the CR-Counter App

This guide explains how to use, when to use, and what to use within the app for best results.

1. Choosing Key, Mode, and Raga

Key: Pick the tonic (starting note) for your arrangement.

Use C, G, F, etc. if you want traditional Western tonality.

Mode:

Available only when no Carnatic Raga is chosen.

Use Major for bright, consonant music, Natural Minor for darker moods, and Harmonic Minor for classical/ethnic flavors.

Raga:

If selected, it overrides Western modes and controls the pitch material.

Pick when exploring Indian/Carnatic tonalities.

The app automatically disables Mode here (best to avoid confusion).

âœ… Best practice:

Use Mode for Western tonal music.

Use Raga for Carnatic/Indian melodic exploration.

2. Arrangement Style

Defines the rhythmic feel and texture of your arrangement.

Examples:

Pop / Rock â†’ predictable, catchy rhythmic patterns.

Jazz / R&B â†’ syncopation, more motion.

World / Classical â†’ traditional counterpoint-like textures.

Styles only affect rhythm & accompaniment, not the pitch content.

âœ… Best practice: Pick a style that matches your intended genre; experiment to see how it interacts with Western or Carnatic scales.

3. Counterpoint Species

Controls how the counter line interacts with the lead.

Species types:

1st Species â†’ one note per bar (simple, meditative).

2nd / 3rd Species â†’ more motion, stepwise interactions.

4th Species â†’ suspensions and resolutions.

5th / Classical â†’ mixed/realistic counterpoint.

âœ… Best practice:

Use Species 1â€“2 for calm, simple arrangements.

Use Species 3â€“5 for more elaborate, expressive textures.

4. Bars, Length & Tempo

Bars (length): More bars = longer music.

Target Tokens: Fine-tune exact number of eighth notes.

Tempo: Controls playback speed (BPM).

âœ… Best practice:

Start small (8â€“16 bars) for testing.

Expand once youâ€™re happy with the sound.

Keep Tempo 90â€“110 BPM for most counterpoint styles; adjust higher for dance/Latin.

5. Instrument Selection

Choose from Lead, Counter, Bass, and Pad instruments.

Roles matter:

Lead: Carries the melody (always required).

Counter: Provides counterpoint line.

Bass: Root motion (tonal grounding).

Pad: Sustains harmony.

âœ… Best practice:

Always select at least one Lead.

Use Bass + Pad for fuller texture.

Add Counter for interplay.

6. Reference Score Upload

Upload a MIDI or MusicXML file to guide the lead contour.

Rhythm still follows chosen style.

Useful for adapting or reimagining existing themes.

âœ… Best practice: Upload a melody if you want to preserve character, but let the app handle rhythm/harmony automatically.

7. Output & Export

MusicXML â†’ Open in MuseScore, Sibelius, Finale for editing/printing.

MIDI â†’ Load into DAWs (Logic, FL Studio, Ableton) for production.

Audio Preview â†’ Quick check of first 4 bars, not polished sound.

âœ… Best practice:

Use MusicXML for notation work.

Use MIDI for DAW production.

Treat audio preview only as a rough sketch.

8. Randomness & Seeds

Random seed ensures reproducibility.

Same seed + same settings = identical score.

âœ… Best practice: Fix a seed if you want to refine a variation; leave 0 for fresh output each time.

ðŸŒŸ Quick Recipes

Western Classical Style:

Key = C, Mode = Major, Style = Classical, Species = 4/5, Instruments = Violin + Viola + Cello + Piano Pad.

Carnatic Fusion:

Key = D, Raga = Kalyani, Style = Jazz/World, Instruments = Flute + Reed + Strings Pad.

Pop Groove:

Key = G, Mode = Major, Style = Pop, Instruments = Flute (lead) + Double Bass + Piano Pad.
